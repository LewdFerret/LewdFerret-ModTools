## Setup
If you don't have typescript installed run:
```bash
npm i typescript -g
```
Then install everything by running:
```bash
npm i
```

Create a config.json in the data directory, containing a valid token and client id:
```json
{
  "token": "[YOUR TOKEN HERE]"
  "client_id": "[YOUR CLIENT ID HERE]"
}
```
